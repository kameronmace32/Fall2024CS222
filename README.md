# grade_tool
Pasted from course plan 9/3/24:
Use TDD to create a Dart library for converting a numeric grade to a letter grade. Create only the
model layer and its associated tests, similar to how we approached the start of the leap year
example. It is sufficient to deal only with simple letter grades, not “plus” nor “minus” grades. A
satisfactory submission will be well-factored, following the rules of Clean Code that we have
studied so far.

The work must be in a repository in our GitHub organization and have been created and managed
through Android Studio. On Canvas, submit a link to your repository.
